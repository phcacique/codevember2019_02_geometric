## About this app
![preview image](/images/02_geometric.PNG)

This app presents the interactions between cells in a grid, based on Conway's Game of Life. In this interpretation, each cell assumes the shape of their neighbors, so it is possible to see a fight between shapes groups.

_This is an iOS app, made in Swift, on XCode and it is a free visual experiment._
